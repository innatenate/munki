MUNKI

The learning voice assistant that adapts to your questions.
This voice assitant breaks down your questions into keywords and compares them
against several keywords required for functions. If an appropriate function/keyword
pair match is found, the command is processed. If the command isn't found perfectly,
Munki will ask you if the command was processed successfully. If so, it gathers information,
from your words to better understand function/keyword pairs.

Munki is best with forecasting. Munki will gather data from Visual Crossing API and compares
data against historical weather patterns to produce it's own representation or forecast. Munki 
also excels at producing non-static dialog by utilizing the random module at almost any time possible.
Munki also has 160+ different dialogs, and 50+ contextual words to pair with, giving a total of almost 300 different
sentences Munki can speak.

I'm attempting to make Munki available cross-platform as I'd love to go back and forth developing
from my different platforms, but it's an issue I'm still struggling with. I'm also still working on
developing a GUI that supports what I am trying to achieve.
